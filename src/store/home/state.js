      body: `
The <a href="#/people"><em>Center for Humanities Computing Aarhus (CHCAA)</em></a> is the spearhead of computationally empowered
humanities research at Aarhus University. We adopt, research and develop tomorrow's data-driven methodologies, tools, and synergies.
Our aim is to provide humanities research with relevant, efficient, and usable computational tools and resources. Whether you need help with
project design, data management, or analytics, we are there to support you. We believe that software should promote, not prevent, open, human-centered
and adaptive research processes. We therefore take pride in developing custom solutions to serve your particular needs and requirements.

      body: `
We acquire, research, and develop state-of-the-art technologies, methodologies, and best practices for research
on digital data in the Humanities. The <em>CHCAA</em> maintains a working pipeline to produce the best
learning material for you to acquire relevant cutting edge technologies in a humane format. We have extensive experience with development of
digital and computational competencies (or literacy) in the humanities. We are also involved in serveral initiatives (<em>The Carpentries</em> and <em>CodeRefinery</em>)
that promote good programming practice and software development for research irrespective of faculty.  These initiatives aim to help researchers to get their work done
in less time and with less pain by teaching them how to write better code and provide research groups with software development e-infrastructure
tools to collaboratively develop, review, discuss, test, and share their codes.

      body: `
CHCAA has strong ties with international researcher groups that explore the cultural information space algorithmically.
Currently we are collaborting with groups from North America, Europe, and China on multiple transdisciplinary research projects.
We are happy to serve as an entry point to this network and include your project as new node. For external partners and stakeholders,
we can connect you with the researchers at Aarhus University that matches your particular needs and preferences. On the infrastructural
side we collaborate with eScience and data providers (e.g., compute centers and national libraries) and Digital Humanities infrastructures
both nationally (e.g., Royal Library Denmark, Danish eInfrastructure Cooperation, DigHumLab) and internationally (Nordic e-Infrastructure
Collaboration, Nordic Digital Humanities Laboratory).

      title: 'How It Works',
      body: `We offer a range of services to researchers at Aarhus University Faculty of Arts. All we ask is that you have a research problem and can point to some relevant data, then we can
      formulate a project together. Our business model varies depending on the task, so please <a href="#/contact">write us a short message</a> telling us what we can do for you. We love to
      co-create projects with domain researchers and embrace user-centered design and development, making you a central part of our work. Depending on the project's scale and our obligations,
      we might have to formulate a funding application together. We guarentee that the digital or computational component (often the methods or infrastructure) is state of the art.
      If you feel more comfortable with "leasing" a developer from the center, then we can supply the candidate that fits your needs.
