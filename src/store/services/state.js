      Do you need to automate analysis of language, audio, images or video? Are your data
      too complex to deal with by hand? Or do you simply want to experiment with the possibilities
      of Artificial Intelligence in your research domain. We offer state-of-the arts
      machine learning and AI to solve your specific problem. Our team research and develop machine learning
      algorithms with a particular interest in applications in the the humanities. We have worked with neural
      networks from back when they were only shallow and have since acquired extensive experience with the major
      deep learning frameworks.

      We offer infrastructure to host data securely. Currently we work on a custom-built domain-specific compiler for
      fulltext-searchable text data services. As per our development paradigms this service will be highly scalable, and
      feature seamless configuration and high usability. We achieve that by using user-maintained database schemas to
      dynamically assemble full-stack web applications with dedicated data backends, synchronized Lucene text-search
      indexes, and fully-featured user interfaces for access controlled CRUD operations.
